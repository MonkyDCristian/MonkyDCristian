### Hello there,  I'm Cris 👋😁

Currently, I am finishing my degree in Computer Engineering, specializing in robotics at the Catholic University of Chile (but I consider myself a ✨robotics software engineer✨/ ROS Developer).
During the last years, I have been developing my skills around the world of robotics usually developing for artificial vision, control, AI, simulation and electronics. Taking on challenging projects is kind of my lifestyle. I am very grateful to the people with whom I have worked, who have allowed me to grow professionally. Besides that, I am always looking forward to learning new cool things 🔥.
